1. Classification of commit, committer, author, date, message etc. (git log) (read the introduction from this paper: http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7816475/)
2. Finding reason of the code changes (git diff)
3. Association rule mining for finding the pattern of code changes (git diff)
4. Comparing number of commit, number of committer, number of author, number of changes (add_loc, del_loc), date etc. between projects with the same programming language. (git log)
5. Finding the most popular programming language in some projects in GitHub repositories by comparing the number of committer, number of author, the starting date of commit etc. (git log, git diff)
6. TDA Implementation in mining software repositories (git log)
7. Project version comparison (git tag)
8. How frequent are popular Android apps updated? (https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10664-015-9388-2)
9. Comparing the entropy of changes after change of code (https://goo.gl/pYnwJr)
10. Predicting the delay of bug fixing or something else (http://rdcu.be/teAy)
11. Large-scale GitHub study, containing variables (http://rdcu.be/twSy)
12. Classification of author's action, i.e update, delete, add, move etc. in GitHub (git log)
13. Literature review, searching papers from some particular journals / proceedings related with software mining repositories. (http://romisatriawahono.net/publications/2016/wahono-slr-may2016.pdf), (http://journal.ilmukomputer.org/index.php/jse/article/view/47)
14. Classification of changes in a project (libraries, functions, comments, loops etc.) (http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7816466/)
15. Systematic mapping study, to visualize the research trends discovery. (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.infsof.2015.03.007)
16. Classification of deleted lines as buggylines, function, loop, conditional statement etc. ("Prevalence of Confusing Code in Software Projects" Link: https://atomsofconfusion.com/papers/atom-finder-msr-2018.pdf)
17. Statistic study (e.g. counting the number of added / deleted lines divided by period, example by year 2010, 2011 etc.)
18. Finding the version of a project that the most used by developers.
19. Code comments extraction from code of a programming language (Classification of the content in code comment, e.g. algorithms, links, etc.)
20. Predicting the delay of a task based on the due date of the issue and their resolution date. (e.g. issue MYFACES-2262, https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MYFACES-2262) (https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2916265) ("Predicting Delays in Software Projects Using Networked Classification", Morakot Choetikertikul, Hoa Khanh Dam, Truyen Tran, Aditya Ghose)
21. Find the probability of new files to be changed in a project. How many times a changed file would be modified in the future.
22. Investigating social factors from community forum (e.g. "Stochastic actor-oriented modeling for studying homophily and social influence in OSS projects" - https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10664-016-9431-y)
23. Studying Q&A site or community forum such as stack overflow, ask ubuntu, etc. (paper example: What are mobile developers asking about? A large scale study using stack overflow, https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10664-015-9379-3)
24. Analyzing relationship between price, rating, and popularity of apps (Ref: Investigating the relationship between price, rating, and popularity in the Blackberry World App Store, https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095058491730215X)
25. Finding the popular modules in a programming language. (e.g. In Python, we used "import" to import modules. We investigate the most popular modules imported in Python. It should be separated based on the Python versions. The files only captured from the latest commits. We can also extended to find the most added and deleted modules imported in python. So the files captured from all commits in a project).
26. Mining forum thread (e.g. Eclipse forum, Stack overflow) to extract the thread purpose, link targets, unanswered questions, etc.
